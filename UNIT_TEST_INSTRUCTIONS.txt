For the aspects of the code that cannot be directly unit tested, 
we will be providing a set of instructions here that will allow the user 
to test each function of the code.



PRE-STEP 1:
    In this repository, we have included the file "test_contacts.db". This 
database is to be used when testing the code in this document. To use it, open address_book.py.
Under the import statements, there should be a line of code that reads as follows:
        connector = sql.connect('contacts.db')
    Please replace "contacts.db" with "test_contacts.db". You will know if you've 
done this correctly in the next step when running the function. 



~~~~ Step 1: Opening the code ~~~~
    Open the terminal in VS Code and type "py address_book.py" or "python address_book.py".
As mentioned in Pre-Step 1, you will know if you've correctly opened the test_contacts.db 
if there is a list of contacts displayed in the listbox under "Saved Contacts". If this is the case, 
proceed to Step 2.



~~~~ Step 2: Adding a contact ~~~~
############### WORKING CASE ###############
Select the "Add Contact" button and add your contact information. For this 
example, we will be using the following information:
        First Name: Jane
        Last Name: Doe
        Address: 123 Main St
                Anytown, USA 12345
        Phone #: 301-555-5555
        Email: jdoe123@umd.edu
        Alternate Email: janedoe123@gmail.com
        Pronouns: she/her
        Notes: From INST326 class
        Group: Student
    After entering this information, press the "Add" button that has appeared at 
the bottom of the page. You should now see your contact in the contact listbox.

############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
    Select the "Add Contact" button and only add information in the FIRST NAME 
field. For this example, only add "Jane" into the field next to the first name 
label, and nothing in the other fields.
    There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! Please fill in the name fields"
Select "OK" from the error window and click the "Clear Fields" button to continue testing.



~~~~ Step 3: Viewing a contact ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
    To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Clear Fields" button 
to un-select any selected contact in the listbox. Once no contact is selected, 
click the "View Contact" button.
There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! No contact 
selected. Please select a contact to continue." Select "OK" from the error window and proceed.

############### WORKING CASE ###############
    Select the contact you created from the contact list. The name should be 
visible as "Jane Doe" if the add contact procedure was executed correctly. If the 
name is correctly selected, it should be highlighted in the listbox. Click "View 
Contact" and the contact information should show up in the you used to enter in 
the information. However, these fields should not be able to be edited, because of the 
read_only_fields() function. The contact information in these fields should show 
as follows:
        First Name: Jane
        Last Name: Doe
        Address: 123 Main St
                Anytown, MD, USA 
                12345
        Phone #: 301-555-5555
        Email: jdoe123@umd.edu
        Alternate Email: janedoe123@gmail.com
        Pronouns: she/her
        Notes: From INST326 class
        Group: Student
    A message box should pop up saying "Contact added. Your contact has been successfully added."
Click the "Clear Fields" button to reset the fields back to normal and to unselect 
the contact in the listbox.



~~~~ Step 4: Searching through contacts ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
    To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Search" button 
without typing anything in the search box. An error messagebox should pop up saying,
"Error! Please enter a search term to proceed." Select "OK" from the error window
and proceed.

############### WORKING CASE ###############
For this search term, we will be searching for contacts using different cases.
        First Case: Search by first name
    Enter "Doug" into the search bar and press the "Search" button. The results should show 
two contacts, "Doug Kammerer" and "Doug Grant". Press the "Back" button to go back to all of the 
results and clear the search bar.
        Second Case: Search by last name
    Enter "Smith" into the search bar. Press the "Search" button. The result should show 
one contact, "Daniella Smith". Press the "Back" button.
        Third Case: Search by full name
    Enter "Hugh Jass" into the search bar. Press the "Search" button. The results should show 
one contact, "Hugh Jass". Press the "Back" button.
        Fourth Case: Search using the wrong spelling
    Enter "O'Connor" into the search bar and press "Search". There should be no results that show 
because Kim O'Conner's last name is spelled -er instead of -or. Press the "Back" button.


~~~~ Step 5: Editing a contact ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
    To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Clear Fields" button 
to un-select any selected contact in the listbox. Once no contact is selected, 
click the "Edit Contact" button.
    There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! No contact 
selected. Please select a contact to continue."
Select "OK" from the error window and proceed.

############### WORKING CASE ###############
    For this example, we will be editing a contact from the list of contacts 
already in the database. From "Saved Contacts" select "Danela Smith" and then 
select the "Edit Contact" button.
    It appears that when the contact was entered someone misspelled 
Daniella's name. It should be "Daniella" instead of "Danela". After selecting 
"Danela Smith" from the contact list and clicking "Edit Contact", we should change Daniella's 
name in the contact fields. Please edit the First Name and Alternate Email field to read as follows:
        First Name: Daniella
        Alternate Email: daniellasmith2@gmail.com
    After changing the field, click the "Edit" button that has appeared below the fields. 
A message box should pop up that says "Contact edited. Your contact has been successfully edited." 
Select "OK" to continue. The contact should be updated and shown in the Saved Contacts list. 
To confirm that the contact has been edited, select "Daniella Smith" from the list and click 
"View Contact". The new contact info should read as follows:
        First Name: Daniella
        Last Name: Smith
        Address: 2134 Green Dr
                Niceville, KY, USA 90007
        Phone #: 513-222-3333
        Email: dsmith2@umd.edu
        Alternate Email: daniellasmith2@gmail.com
        Pronouns: they/them
        Notes: INST327-0202 TA
            Office Hours: MWF 3-4pm on Zoom
        Group: TA
    Click the "Clear Fields" button to reset the fields back to normal and to unselect 
the contact in the listbox.



~~~~ Step 6: Deleting a single contact ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Clear Fields" button 
to un-select any selected contact in the listbox. Once no contact is selected, 
click the "Delete Contact" button.
    There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! No contact 
selected. Please select a contact to continue."
Select "OK" from the error window and proceed.

############### WORKING CASE ###############
    For this step, we will be deleting Kim O'Connor's contact. As we can see from the notes section, 
we knew Kim from HIST111, a Gen-Ed class that we aren't taking anymore. Because of this, we can 
delete her contact. To do so, click the "Delete Contact" button. Once this is clicked, a messagebox
pops up saying "Are you sure you want to delete this contact? NOTE: This action cannot be undone."
    First, test a case where you might change your mind about deleting a contact. Select "No".
Once selected, the messagebox is closed. Next, click the "Delete Contact" button again and this time, 
select "Yes". A message should then pop up saying: "Contact deleted. The contact you have selected 
has been deleted.". Proceed to the next step.



~~~~ Step 7: Deleting all contacts ~~~~
############### WORKING CASE ###############
For this step, we will be deleting all of the contacts. To do so, click the "Delete All Contacts" button. 
Once this is clicked, a messagebox pops up saying "Are you sure you want to delete ALL contacts? 
NOTE: This action cannot be undone."
    First, test a case where you might change your mind about deleting the contacts. Select "No".
Once selected, the messagebox is closed. Next, click the "Delete Contact" button again and this time, 
select "Yes". A message should then pop up saying: "Success. All of the contacts in your address book 
have been deleted". Proceed to the next step.
