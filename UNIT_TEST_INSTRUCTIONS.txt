For the aspects of the code that cannot be directly unit tested, 
we will be providing a set of instructions here that will allow the user 
to test each function of the code.

~~~~ Step 1: Opening the code ~~~~
Open the terminal in VS Code and type "py address_book.py" or "python address_book.py"


~~~~ Step 2: Adding a contact ~~~~
############### WORKING CASE ###############
Select the "Add Contact" button and add your contact information. For this 
example, we will be using the following information:
First Name: Jane
Last Name: Doe
Address: 123 Main St
         Anytown, USA 12345
Phone #: 301-555-5555
Email: jdoe123@umd.edu
Alternate Email: janedoe123@gmail.com
Pronouns: she/her
Notes: From INST326 class
Group: Student

After entering this information, press the "Add" button that has appeared at 
the bottom of the page. You should now see your contact in the contact listbox.

############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
Select the "Add Contact" button and only add information in the FIRST NAME 
field. For this example, only add "Jane" into the field next to the first name 
label, and nothing in the other fields.
There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! Please fill in the name fields"
Select "OK" from the error window and click the "Clear Fields" button to continue testing.

~~~~ Step 3: Viewing a contact ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Clear Fields" button 
to un-select any selected contact in the listbox. Once no contact is selected, 
click the "View Contact" button.
There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! No contact 
selected. Please select a contact to continue."
Select "OK" from the error window and proceed.

############### WORKING CASE ###############
Select the contact you created from the contact list. The name should be 
visible as "Jane Doe" if the add contact procedure was executed correctly. If the 
name is correctly selected, it should be highlighted in the listbox. Click "View 
Contact" and the contact information should show up in the you used to enter in 
the information. However, these fields should not be able to be edited, because of the 
read_only_fields() function. The contact information in these fields should show 
as follows:
First Name: Jane
Last Name: Doe
Address: 123 Main St
         Anytown, USA 12345
Phone #: 301-555-5555
Email: jdoe123@umd.edu
Alternate Email: janedoe123@gmail.com

Click the "Clear Fields" button to reset the fields back to normal and to unselect 
the contact in the listbox.


~~~~ Step 4: Editing a contact ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Clear Fields" button 
to un-select any selected contact in the listbox. Once no contact is selected, 
click the "Edit Contact" button.
