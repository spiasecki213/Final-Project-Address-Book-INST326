For the aspects of the code that cannot be directly unit tested, 
we will be providing a set of instructions here that will allow the user 
to test each function of the code.


~~~~ Step 1: Opening the code ~~~~
Open the terminal in VS Code and type "py address_book.py" or "python address_book.py"



~~~~ Step 2: Adding a contact ~~~~
############### WORKING CASE ###############
Select the "Add Contact" button and add your contact information. For this 
example, we will be using the following information:
        First Name: Jane
        Last Name: Doe
        Address: 123 Main St
                Anytown, USA 12345
        Phone #: 301-555-5555
        Email: jdoe123@umd.edu
        Alternate Email: janedoe123@gmail.com
        Pronouns: she/her
        Notes: From INST326 class
        Group: Student
    After entering this information, press the "Add" button that has appeared at 
the bottom of the page. You should now see your contact in the contact listbox.

############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
    Select the "Add Contact" button and only add information in the FIRST NAME 
field. For this example, only add "Jane" into the field next to the first name 
label, and nothing in the other fields.
    There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! Please fill in the name fields"
Select "OK" from the error window and click the "Clear Fields" button to continue testing.



~~~~ Step 3: Viewing a contact ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
    To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Clear Fields" button 
to un-select any selected contact in the listbox. Once no contact is selected, 
click the "View Contact" button.
There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! No contact 
selected. Please select a contact to continue."
Select "OK" from the error window and proceed.

############### WORKING CASE ###############
    Select the contact you created from the contact list. The name should be 
visible as "Jane Doe" if the add contact procedure was executed correctly. If the 
name is correctly selected, it should be highlighted in the listbox. Click "View 
Contact" and the contact information should show up in the you used to enter in 
the information. However, these fields should not be able to be edited, because of the 
read_only_fields() function. The contact information in these fields should show 
as follows:
        First Name: Jane
        Last Name: Doe
        Address: 123 Main St
                Anytown, MD, USA 
                12345
        Phone #: 301-555-5555
        Email: jdoe123@umd.edu
        Alternate Email: janedoe123@gmail.com
        Pronouns: she/her
        Notes: From INST326 class
        Group: Student
    A message box should pop up saying "Contact added. Your contact has been successfully added."
Click the "Clear Fields" button to reset the fields back to normal and to unselect 
the contact in the listbox.


~~~~ Step 4: Editing a contact ~~~~
############### NON-WORKING CASE ###############
    To test the non-working case, start off by clicking the "Clear Fields" button 
to un-select any selected contact in the listbox. Once no contact is selected, 
click the "Edit Contact" button.
    There should be an error window that pops up that says "Error! No contact 
selected. Please select a contact to continue."
Select "OK" from the error window and proceed.

############### WORKING CASE ###############
    For this example, we will be adding a new contact. Using the add_contact() procedure we 
went over in step 1, add the following information into a NEW contact:
        First Name: Danela
        Last Name: Smith
        Address: 2134 Green Dr
                Niceville, KY, USA 90007
        Phone #: 513-222-3333
        Email: dsmith2@umd.edu
        Alternate Email: danelasmith2@gmail.com
        Pronouns: they/them
        Notes: INST327 TA
            Office Hours: MWF 3-4pm on Zoom
        Group: TA
    Select the contact you created from the contact list. The name should be 
visible as "Danela Smith" if the add contact procedure was executed correctly. If the 
name is correctly selected, it should be highlighted in the listbox. Click "Edit 
Contact" and the contact information should show up in the you used to enter in 
the information. These fields SHOULD be able to be edited, because of the 
normal_fields() function called in edit_contact. The contact information in these fields 
should show as follows:
        First Name: Danela
        Last Name: Smith
        Address: 2134 Green Dr
                Niceville, KY, USA 90007
        Phone #: 513-222-3333
        Email: dsmith2@umd.edu
        Alternate Email: danelasmith2@gmail.com

        Notes: INST327 TA
            Office Hours: MWF 3-4pm on Zoom
        Group: TA
    Now, to edit the contact. It appears that when we entered the contact into the list, 
we misspelled Daniella's name. It should be "Daniella" instead of "Danela". After selecting 
"Danela Smith" from the contact list and clicking "Edit Contact", we should change Daniella's 
name in the contact fields. Please edit the First Name  and Alternate Email field to read as follows:
        First Name: Daniella
        Alternate Email: daniellasmith2@gmail.com
    After changing the field, click the "Edit" button that has appeared below the fields. 
A message box should pop up that says "Contact edited. Your contact has been successfully edited." 
Select "OK" to continue. The contact should be updated and shown in the Saved Contacts list. 
To confirm that the contact has been edited, select "Daniella Smith" from the list and click 
"View Contact". The new contact info should read as follows:
        First Name: Daniella
        Last Name: Smith
        Address: 2134 Green Dr
                Niceville, KY, USA 90007
        Phone #: 513-222-3333
        Email: dsmith2@umd.edu

    Click the "Clear Fields" button to reset the fields back to normal and to unselect 
the contact in the listbox.
